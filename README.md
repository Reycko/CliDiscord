# CliDiscord
WiP thing to put discord (sending &amp; receiving messages) in the comfort of terminal with a python script
## Commands & Setup
To properly use CliDiscord, you need to provide 2 arguments: the bot token, and the channel id, you can use a built-in "run" batch script that is built in.
## How to install
As this is a python script and I don't feel like using pyinstaller, you just have to:
1) Either download the Code from the github website, or clone the repo using git
2) Open Terminal (macOS / Linux) or the Windows Command Prompt (windows, powershell also works), and open either run_sh or run_win depending on your operating system.
3) Input your token and the desired channel id
